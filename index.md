# About IGEN 
[Integrated Engineering](https://www.integratedengineers.ca/) is a one of a kind, group project focused, and interdisciplinary engineering degree in which students learn fundamental engineering concepts in each of the classical disciplines. Not only do we get to work on a year long capstone in our 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years - we get the experience of concept generation and pitching our ideas to our peers. 

Our multidisciplinary foundation is supplemented by choosing a major and minor discipline to further study after tasteing a bit of each engineering flavor. Each student can take a unique educational route, making our projects substantially more interesting than a capstone filled of 5 students from the same facutly. For example, software focused students get to work closely with students who love cars (mech), students who prefer to herd electrons (elec), and students who like to work with concrete (civil).
