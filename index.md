# Welcome to my Portfolio!

# About
My name is Adam Fong and I'm a 3rd year Integrated Engineering (IGEN) student at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver campus. (If you haven't heard about IGEN before, [click me!](#about-igen)). I love learning practical skills and applying them to new and old problems. My current muse is data analysis but I'm pretty content whenever I have a fun problem that can be tackled with code. When I'm not working on my projects, I love getting outside spending time soaking in the sunshine (or more accurately, rain) in Beautiful British Columbia.

## Bike Sentry
### Summary
Bike Sentry is a solution that my capstone team and I have generated to combat an issue that crosses all cyclist's minds at differing capacities - bike theft. Our solution elegantly combined all of the interests of our diverse group members by including non-trivial tasks in software, electrical, and mechanical engineering. We split our group of five into three subteams: mechanical, electrical, and software. My role is on the software subteam.

As there are still a couple of months left in our academic term, we have yet to finish but have maintained steady prototyping.

### Summary
My love for outdoor sports arose when I first moved to Vancouver, BC. I picked up road cycling, open water swimming, scrambling, trail running, and continued rock climbing. Vancouver is truly a one-of-a-kind location for an outdoor enthusiast. The tough reality of being a "weekend warrior" free weekends become scarce as the school year progresses. Luckily for UBC students, we have immediate access to over 70 kilometers of beautiful trails in our backyard paradise, Pacific Spirit Regional Park (PSP).

I've spent many hours running and biking through PSP and have loved every minute of it - my exercising time in the forest is how I recover from long days. But like all things, the trails that I frequent have become more and more familiar and my drive to get out to the far corners of the park has faded. But I like to throw code at my problems so no worries! 

[Star Collector](https://github.com/afong3/StarCollector) a tool which takes my (and some of my other trail enthusiasts') GPX data from Strava and highlights which trails have and haven't been traveled since a given date. The pursuit of collecting all the stars has been a great motivator and showed me portions of the park that I would have missed otherwise. My code has been written so that I could easily adapt this 'star collection' to be implemented on any trail / road network. This could even be leveraged into a reward system (if this tool was implemented on some social platform)! But for now, it just removes the mental load of deciding what my route will be. All I have to do is go collect a new star and I'll be satisfied. 

### Progress
- Data retrievel from Strava's REST api
- Automatic map generation with red and gold stars for uncollected and collected 

### TODO
- integrate Strava's OAuth2.0 protocol with redirects for any Strava user to use the app
- Attempt to convert this into ReactJS

# About IGEN 
[Integrated Engineering](https://www.integratedengineers.ca/) is a one of a kind, group-project focused, and interdisciplinary engineering degree in which students learn fundamental engineering concepts in each of the classical disciplines. Not only do we get to work on a year long capstone in our 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years - we think of and propose the projects, giving us experience in concept generation and effectively pitching our ideas to our peers. 

Our multidisciplinary foundation is supplemented by choosing a major and minor discipline to further study after tasteing a bit of each engineering flavor. Each student can take a unique educational route, making our group projects substantially more interesting than a capstone filled of 5 students from the same discipline. For example, software focused students get to work closely with students who love cars (mech), students who prefer to herd electrons (elec), and students who like to putting concrete under compression (civil).
